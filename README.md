# AVAX_Module3
This project implements a simple ERC20 token smart contract. The contract allows for token minting, burning, and transferring functionalities.

## Description

This smart contract represents a basic ERC-20-like token and includes key functionalities commonly found in such tokens. The token contract allows the contract owner to mint new tokens, any token holder to burn their tokens, and any token holder to transfer tokens to other addresses.

Please note that this implementation is a simplified version and lacks full compliance with the ERC-20 standard.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this smart contract, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or create a new Solidity file in your development environment.
2. Copy and paste the provided token smart contract code into your Solidity file.

### Executing Program

To deploy and interact with the token contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum network or a local development network using Remix or your preferred Ethereum development environment.

2. Interact with the contract using the following functions:
   - `mintTokens(address to, uint256 amount)`: The contract owner can use this function to mint new tokens to the specified address `to`.

   - `burnTokens(uint256 amount)`: Any token holder can use this function to burn (destroy) their own tokens.

   - `transferTokens(address _receiver, uint256 amount)`: Any token holder can use this function to transfer tokens to another address `_receiver`.

## Help
